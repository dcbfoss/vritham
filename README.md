# vritham
A padyam/poem can be ‘read’, ‘recited’ or ‘sung’. In each of these performances, a poem may exhibit specific (and possibly different) rhythmic patterns. In the Sanskrit tradition,the linguistic rhythm pattern in the ‘reading’ of the poem (without any conscious effort to elongate or stress syllables, and without bringing in a melody/tune/Raga) is known as its “Vritham”, (Eg: Indra Vajra, Upendra Vajra, ShardoolaVikreeditham, Kusuma Manjari etc). 

In Dravidian tradition, Vritham is more related to rhythmic pattern that manifest in the ‘recital’ or ‘singing’ of the poem, when syllables are often elongated or shortened (Eg: Tharangini, Kakali, Keka etc). Both Sanskrit and Dravidian meters have been used in Malayalam, but the later is popular in modern times.
